Should version specific features (eg LRA Remount/bugfixes or .com Scarf) be plugins?

timeline engine operations
- adding and removing individual skeletons (cascade delete)
- adding and removing mounts (unlink skeletons)
- caching point states for each frame (basic clone)
- caching mount states for each frame (basic clone)
- removing from and adding to cache size whenever mounts change
- clearing front of cache whenever lines change
- swapping cached point states whenever frame info requested
- moving green lines?

Engine Constraints
Skeletons: <= 50
Bones: <= 2,500
Points: <= 2,500
Mounts: <= 25
Physics Lines <= 10,000
Scenery Lines <= ~100,000,000?

idea: vec with mount bone/joint diffs at different frames, then cumulatively construct by moving along
frame 0: list[(id, id), (id, id), ...]
frame 10: list[(id, id), (id, id), ...]
frame 20: list[(id, id), (id, id), ...]

idea: skeletons and mounts as traits
- allow for custom skeleton/mount implementations
- traits describe required functions for usage
